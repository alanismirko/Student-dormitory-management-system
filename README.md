# UCNThirdSemesterProject

The student dormitory management system (STUDO) is designed for dormitories that want to have software that will ease everyday tasks. 
We designed our system to be user friendly with all the features necessary to make a booking process simple for students, and management processes easy for dormitory administrators.
Our system has two types of users. The first type are students that are able to book a room online and manage their personal information. The second type are administrators (managers of dormitories) who are able to accept/decline the bookings, manage the rooms, and other information.
